# Computer-graphics
The cg .text file is the code in C++ for the flood filling algorithm in computer graphics . Over here i have used the algorithm which uses 
a recursive approach to fill the shape.I have used a circle of radius not more than 30.If you understand the algorithm then you can easily
apply it for not only circles but also for rectangles and many more.

The second file that is dda.txt is the code in C++ for the Digital Differential Analyzer Line drawing algorithm . It is the most basic algorithm in Computer Graphics which draws a line on the screen . Different Animations can be done using this algorithm by adjusting the slopes,co-ordinates etc.,all that needs to be done is a thorough understanding of the algorithm which i think would be clear from the code if you have even a little bit knowledge of language .
