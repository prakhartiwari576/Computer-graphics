# Computer-graphics
The cg .text file is the code in C++ for the flood filling algorithm in computer graphics . Over here i have used the algorithm which uses 
a recursive approach to fill the shape.I have used a circle of radius not more than 30.If you understand the algorithm then you can easily
apply it for not only circles but also for rectangles and many more.
